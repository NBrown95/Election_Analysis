# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project, we are auditing election results for the election commission in Colorado. To complete the audit we analyzed voting data from the three counties involved in this election. We then determined how many votes each candidate received, what percentage of votes each candidate received, which candidate won the election, what the voter turnout was for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and which county had the largest voter turnout.

## Election – Audit Results

There were 369,711 total votes cast in this congressional election. The following image shows the election results. These results will be further discussed below.

## Election – Audit Summary

This script is not only useful for this congressional election. There are modifications that can be made for any election. One example is that we can modify the script to determine which candidate won each county. This allows us to determine if one candidate is only liked in the largest county and that led to the election win or if they were well liked throughout all the counties.

Another example on how to use this script for future elections is to expand the amount of counties or votes. For instance, this script could be used for federal elections or statewide elections. There would only need to be slight modifications as this script will essentially write all the new counties and candidates itself.
